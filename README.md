# static-site-hello-world
Web dev is hard. This stack gives you more tools to deal with the suck. Mostly just a template for me to copy when I make new sites.

## Philosophy
Software has bugs. The question is when do you find them?

From most Undesirable to most Desirable places to catch your bugs and exceptions:
Production, user-detected ➤ Production, self-detected ➤ CD ➤ Nightly CI ➤ CI ➤ develop time ➤ impossible to write

Every one of the tools in this stack pushes a whole class of errors to be caught in a more desirable stage.
